# VOID LABS PROJECT

## Overview
VOID LABS is an interactive project featuring a **Lift-Type Navigation System** and immersive **3D Simulations** of various scientific concepts. This project allows users to explore and interact with simulations in a virtual environment.

## Features
- **Lift-Type Navigation System** for seamless movement between sections.
- **3D Simulations** of:
  - Periodic Table
  - Kirchhoff's Law
  - Biology Lab
  - Solar System
  - Gas Laws Experiments
  - Data Structures (Stack, Queue, Array)

## Getting Started
### Running the Project
To start the project, **open** `index.html` in a web browser. This serves as the main entry point for the VOID LABS system.

### Installation
No additional installation is required. Ensure you have a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) for the best experience.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- WebGL / Three.js for 3D simulations

## Usage
1. Open `hall.html` to access the navigation system.
2. Use the lift-type navigation to move between different simulations.
3. Interact with various 3D models and experiments.

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.
